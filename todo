- add the shadow pic behind the characters
- put the clouds behind the characters

video-page: NICO!

- redirect to the book after the video is done (10s?)

navbar: MARCO
- correct the position of the navbar (add text-shadow to it --> hoovering effect)
- maybe put it into one container with the ufo



book: MUSTAFA!

- center the opened book, don't center the cover
- fill the content in the textbook

- fix the error messages
- insert the pics from Tamas for the team members
- the pages are moving in the wrong order if you go forward through it
