Prio1!

Design: TAMAS!
- change the invertion of the pics --> reverse it --> Tamas
- make the pictures for the team-member fields (tilted with tape on the corner)

index.html NICO!
- we need smaller version of the pics or resizable pics. The page is  now not even showing on FullHD all the characters on it (responsive)
- add the shadow pic behind the characters
- put the clouds behind the characters

video-page: NICO!
- No sound in video
- do we really need the control bar in the videos? --> remove the controls and put a black skip button and a back to index.html on the left bottom corner
- redirect to the book after the video is done (10s?)

navbar: MARCO
- correct the position of the navbar (add text-shadow to it --> hoovering effect)
- maybe put it into one container with the ufo



book: MUSTAFA!
- put the background image screenshot from index.html (change the background to the screenshot of the index (add some blur))
- center the opened book, don't center the cover
- fill the content in the textbook
- add a backlink to the index.html
- fix the error messages
- insert the pics from Tamas for the team members
- the pages are moving in the wrong order if you go forward through it

submit: MUSTAFA
- change background
