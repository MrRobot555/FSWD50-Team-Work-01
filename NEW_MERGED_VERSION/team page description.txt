Hi, my name is Delia. I am working as a front-end web developer within the company for 3 years now. 

I enjoy the job because of the self reward of finishing a project and the ability to see the website from anywhere in the world on any device. The internet is so powerful and I love the reward from creating something that has the potential to be viewed by so many people.

Before joining the company I was working as an cost controller at an oil and gas company and few years ago I decided I need to change careers because I was tired of the routine of working only with numbers.

In my free time I love reading novels—it is something I try to do every day, even if it is only for a few minutes before bed. Reading novels helps relax me, and also helps me think more creatively.

I love authentic Italian food but one dish that I love the most is Pizza. Being a cheese lover, there’s no dish better than pizza.

Hi, I'm Marco! I work for this company forever, that's why I also have an id in the inventory database. In my past I studied Cultural Science and Computer Science for about 35 years. Most of my time I keeping guard that nobody is insulting my boss! I'm his favourite worker and that is because I'm working really hard! I like most that my boss is treating people really fair, as long as they do a good job! And that is, what you actually should do, or the boss is not happy, and you want the boss to be happy!

My funniest moment at work was, when I was dropping databases (that's a hobby of mine) and accidentally dropped one of the production dbs. The punishment was hard in the beginning, and I was degraded to an intern, but in the end, I learned a lot (don't drop production databases!) and I can laugh about this now.

In my leisure time I do archery, programming and playing table tennis. Sadly I have only time on Sunday after church. The rest of the hours in a week I'm working at work or in the community center. My favourite dish are potatoes!

I really enjoy the job and I think our boss is awesome!
