Hi, my name is Delia. I am working as a front-end web developer within the company for 3 years now. 

I enjoy the job because of the self reward of finishing a project and the ability to see the website from anywhere in the world on any device. The internet is so powerful and I love the reward from creating something that has the potential to be viewed by so many people.

Before joining the company I was working as an cost controller at an oil and gas company and few years ago I decided I need to change careers because I was tired of the routine of working only with numbers.

In my free time I love reading novels—it is something I try to do every day, even if it is only for a few minutes before bed. Reading novels helps relax me, and also helps me think more creatively.

I love authentic Italian food but one dish that I love the most is Pizza. Being a cheese lover, there’s no dish better than pizza.
